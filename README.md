# Network Rack Installation

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involved the **assembly and installation of a structured network rack system** for organizing and housing IT network devices such as switches, patch panels, routers, and power distribution units (PDUs). The setup ensures a clean, scalable, and efficient data infrastructure for future expansion and easy maintenance.
